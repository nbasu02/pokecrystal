Major changes:

- Dark and Dragon are now physical types, Poison and Ghost are now special types
- Many changes to pokemon types, stats, movesets, and encounter locations (see accompanying csv files)
- Goldenrod game corner offers Voltorb, Dratini, and Porygon
- All trade evolutions are changed to level up, or using their corresponding trade item
- Can evolve Eevee to Umbreon and Espeon with the Moon and Sun Stones
- Overall difficulty increased, especially boss battles
- Level curve updated, where trainers now get stronger throughout the course of the game instead of stagnating for long periods of time
- Some updates made Ecruteak include adding a small pond near the west exit and adding a barrier after the entrance to Mahogany.  This requires the player to use Surf to leave Ecruteak, and Fly to enter Mahogany
- Only Dark Cave and Rock Tunnel require Flash (notably, Mt Silver does not, so you don't need to sacrifice a move slot to battle red)
- GS Ball found in Victory Road
- HM Moves can be forgotten just like any other move.  The original idea of making HM moves not removable is to prevent softlocks in Gen 1, but in Gen 2 this is not necessary given you can always have HMs in your bag.  You can still deposit HMs and so may softlock yourself, but unlike Gen 1 there is never a need to clear your inventory
- The Elite 4 and Champion now have rematch teams after beating Blue
- Can buy all evolutionary stones and a few more TMs in Goldenrod
- Can buy all trade evolution items in other pokemarts in Johto
- Can buy all Johto Gym TMs at the Indigo Plateau
- Can buy all Kanto Gym TMs in Celadon
- All items that boost type damage increased from 10% to 20%, and are found in the Celadon Dept Store
- Revives and Max Revives cannot be used in-battle
- The player cannot switch pokemon after KOing an opponent's pokemon when fighting gym leaders, elite 4, the champion, rocket executives, the rival, or against Eusine, even if the options are set to Shift
- Many pokemon changes are done in an attempt to not have some pokemon "outclass" others.  For example, Fearow is faster than Dodrio and Pigeot, Dodrio hits hardest, and Pigeot has the most bulk
- Sleep only lasts at most 4 turns
- Having Suicune in your party, you can receive the GS Ball while leaving the Goldenrod City Pokemon Center
- After beating Blue, you can capture Articuno (outside Blaine's gym), Moltres (Victory Road), Zapdos (outside the power plant), Mew (Viridian Forest), and Mewtwo (Mt Silver Cave)

Minor Changes:

- Nurses automatically heal your pokemon when talked to - no need to keep mashing A
- Both Dragon Scale and Dragon Fang boost Dragon type attack (in the original, Dragon Scale had the boost effect instead of Dragon Fang)
- The Lapras that appears on Fridays is always shiny
- One of the Rocket HQ Electrodes is always shiny
- All Pokemaniacs have shiny pokemon
- Can buy as many moomoo milk as you want (previously could not buy if there's one in your pack)
- Can now Dig/Escape Rope out of the goldenrod radio tower
- Berry Juice buffed to healing 50HP
- Lugia now holds an item called Silver Charm, which increases catch rate when held
- The trainer you battle in the Viridian City Trainer House is hard-coded, and cannot be changed with Mystery Gift (which is unlikely to come up in emulation)
- Rematch trainers now ask for phone numbers immediately, and will have improved teams more quickly (previously needed to battle them a certain number of times)

Move changes not documented in moves.csv:
- Moonlight, Synthesis, and Morning Sun always recover 1/2 of maximum health in clear weather regardless of time of day
- Cut and Drill Peck now have an incresed critical hit ratio
- using Hidden Power (should) have a base power of 70 regardless of DVs
- Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Sandstorm now last 8 turns instead of 5

Bug Fixes:

- bugs surrounding Moon Ball not working, Fast Ball only working on three pokemon, and Love Ball doing the opposite of intended are fixed
- fix bug where in the original, burn, paralysis, and poison do not affect catch rate
- fix Light Ball/Thick Club overflow glitch
- Fix bug(?) in which moves that increase your own stats after hitting an opponent (i.e. Metal Claw, Steel Wing, Ancientpower) previously skipped this stat increase if you KOed the opponent
